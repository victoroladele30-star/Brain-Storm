# Controller Decomposition Audit

## Controllers Analyzed

### ✅ Well-Structured (No Changes Needed)

- **CoursesController** - Already uses CoursesBusinessService
- **ModerationController** - Clean HTTP layer, delegates to ModerationService
- **AuthController** - Properly delegates to AuthService
- **AnalyticsController** - Uses dedicated service

### ⚠️ Needs Refactoring

#### 1. UsersController

**Issues:**

- Inline authorization logic in update() method
- Mixed HTTP concerns with business rules

**Recommendation:**

- Move authorization checks to UsersService
- Extract profile ownership validation to service method

#### 2. EnrollmentsController (if exists)

**Check for:**

- Business logic for enrollment validation
- Progress calculation logic
- Certificate issuance logic

## Action Items

1. Extract authorization logic from UsersController to UsersService
2. Verify other controllers follow service delegation pattern
3. Ensure all tests pass after refactoring
