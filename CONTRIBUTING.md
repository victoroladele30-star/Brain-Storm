# Contributing to Brain-Storm

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Brain-Storm! We welcome contributions from the community to help make blockchain education accessible to everyone.

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you agree to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behaviour to the maintainers.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Clone your fork** locally: `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Brain-Storm.git`
3. **Follow the [Developer Setup Guide](docs/development-setup.md)** to set up your environment.
4. **Create a new branch** from `main` for your change (see naming conventions below).
5. Make your changes, add tests, and open a pull request.

## Branch Naming Conventions

| Prefix      | When to use                                              |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat/`     | New feature — e.g. `feat/api-key-rotation`               |
| `fix/`      | Bug fix — e.g. `fix/xss-sanitization`                    |
| `docs/`     | Documentation only — e.g. `docs/contract-guide`          |
| `chore/`    | Maintenance, tooling, deps — e.g. `chore/upgrade-nestjs` |
| `refactor/` | Code restructure with no behaviour change                |
| `test/`     | Adding or fixing tests                                   |

Branch names must be lowercase and use hyphens, not underscores.

## Commit Message Format (Conventional Commits)

We enforce [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) via `commitlint`. Every commit message must follow this structure:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

| Type       | Description                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `feat`     | A new feature                                    |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                                        |
| `docs`     | Documentation changes only                       |
| `style`    | Formatting, missing semicolons — no logic change |
| `refactor` | Code change that is neither a fix nor a feature  |
| `test`     | Adding or correcting tests                       |
| `chore`    | Build process, dependency updates, tooling       |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                          |
| `ci`       | CI/CD configuration changes                      |

### Scope (optional but encouraged)

Use the affected module: `auth`, `courses`, `users`, `stellar`, `contracts`, `frontend`, `docs`, etc.

### Examples

```
feat(auth): add API key authentication for service-to-service calls
fix(courses): strip HTML from description before saving
docs(contracts): add end-to-end credential issuance flow
chore(deps): upgrade @stellar/stellar-sdk to v13
```

Breaking changes must include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer:

```
feat(auth)!: remove legacy /v0 endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE: All clients must migrate to /v1 endpoints.
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Keep PRs small and focused** — one logical change per PR.
2. **Fill in the PR template** completely.
3. **Ensure all CI checks pass** before requesting review.
4. **Link the related issue** using `Closes #<issue-number>` in the PR description.
5. **Request at least one review** from a maintainer.
6. **Address all review comments** before merging.
7. PRs are merged via **squash merge** to keep a clean history.

## Review Checklist

Before submitting your PR, verify:

- [ ] Code follows the style guide (`npm run lint` passes).
- [ ] All existing tests pass (`npm run test`).
- [ ] New tests are added for new behaviour.
- [ ] Commits follow Conventional Commits format.
- [ ] Documentation is updated if behaviour changes.
- [ ] No secrets or PII are committed.
- [ ] PR description clearly explains the _what_ and _why_.

## Development Workflow

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run backend in watch mode
npm run dev:backend

# Run tests
cd apps/backend && npm test

# Lint
npm run lint
```

See [docs/development-setup.md](docs/development-setup.md) for the full setup guide.

## Shared Test Fixtures

We maintain a shared test-fixtures module in `packages/types/src/test-utils/` that exports factory functions for every shared domain type.  **Always use these factories instead of hand-building inline mock objects** in tests.

### Why

Hand-built mocks like `{ id: '1', email: 'test@example.com' } as User` drift from the real type definition whenever a field is added, renamed, or removed.  Factories catch those changes at the point of definition instead of silently diverging across dozens of test files.

### Import path

```typescript
import {
  UserFactory,
  CourseFactory,
  EnrollmentFactory,
  QuizFactory,
  CredentialFactory,
  ProgressFactory,
  PaymentFactory,
} from '@brain-storm/types/test-utils';
```

### Basic usage

```typescript
// Single object with defaults
const user = UserFactory.create();

// Single object with overrides
const admin = UserFactory.create({ role: 'admin', email: 'admin@example.com' });

// Batch of objects
const students = UserFactory.createMany(10, { role: 'student' });

// Cross-entity relationship
const userId = 'user-123';
const courseId = 'course-456';
const enrollment = EnrollmentFactory.create({ userId, courseId, status: 'active' });
const progress   = ProgressFactory.create({ userId, courseId, progressPct: 75 });
const credential = CredentialFactory.create({ userId, courseId, status: 'issued' });
const payment    = PaymentFactory.create({ userId, courseId, amount: 4999 });
```

### Rules

1. **Pin fields you assert on** — don't rely on random defaults for test assertions; always override the fields your test cares about.
2. **Share IDs explicitly** — when two entities must relate, pass the same `userId`/`courseId` to both factories rather than letting them each generate independent IDs.
3. **Don't mutate factory output** — each call produces an independent plain object.
4. **Add new factories** whenever you add a new shared type:
   - Define the interface in `packages/types/src/test-utils/index.ts`
   - Add `create()` and `createMany()` factory methods
   - Export from the index
   - Add tests in `packages/types/src/test-utils/factories.test.ts`

## Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, **do not open a public issue**. Follow our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) for responsible disclosure.

## API Versioning

All REST endpoints are prefixed with `/v1`. Before introducing any breaking change you **must** follow the process in [docs/api-versioning.md](docs/api-versioning.md). In short:

1. Implement the change under a new prefix (`/v2/...`) — never modify `/v1` in place.
2. Mark the old endpoint deprecated in Swagger (`@ApiOperation({ deprecated: true })`).
3. Add `Deprecation` and `Sunset` response headers to the old endpoint.
4. Use a `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` commit so Release Please bumps the major version.
5. Keep both versions running for **at least 90 days** before removing `/v1`.

See [docs/api-versioning.md](docs/api-versioning.md) for the full strategy, deprecation timeline, and migration examples.

## Historical One-Off Migration Scripts

The following scripts were used once to migrate the codebase and have since been **removed** (issue #1197). They are documented here for historical reference only — do not recreate them.

| Script | What it did | Applied in |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `fix-catch-clauses.mjs` | Added `unknown` typing to `catch (err)` / `catch (error)` clauses in the backend | Committed prior to removal |
| `fix-test-casts.mjs` | Added `as TestUserInput` casts to `service.create()` calls in integration specs | Committed prior to removal |
| `fix-ts2564.mjs` | Added `!` definite-assignment assertions to a subset of entity properties (TS2564) | Committed prior to removal |
| `fix-ts2564-all.mjs` | Broader pass of the same TS2564 fix across all DTO and entity files | Committed prior to removal |

All fixes from these scripts are already committed to the codebase. The scripts themselves were removed once verified. If you need to perform a similar mass codebase transformation in the future, create a new migration script under `scripts/` (not the repo root), run it, commit the result, and remove the script in the same PR.
