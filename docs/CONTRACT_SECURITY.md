| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| token          | ✅ `admin.require_auth()` on mint, burn, set_admin             | ✅ `from.require_auth()` on transfer; `owner.require_auth()` on approve | Auth verified in all state-mutating functions      |
| market         | ✅ `admin.require_auth()` on fee set, pause, treasury withdraw | ✅ `payer.require_auth()` on escrow fund                                | `initialize` checks `!has(Admin)` — safe           |
| governance     | ✅ `admin.require_auth()` on config                            | ✅ `proposer.require_auth()` on create; voter auth on cast              | Weighted voting reduces sybil risk                 |
| badges         | ✅ admin-only minting, type definitions                        | N/A                                                                     | Badges are soulbound; transfer rejected            |
| certificate    | ✅ admin/issuer-only minting                                   | N/A                                                                     | Soulbound by default                               |

| dispute        | ✅ arbiter gating                                              | ✅ parties auth on submission                                           | Lifecycle state machine enforced                   |

### Reentrancy Review

| Contract   | Reentrancy Guard                              | Risk Level | Notes                                            |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| token      | ✅ Custom lock in `transfer`, `transfer_from` | Low        | Guard uses storage boolean; released on exit     |
| market     | ✅ State updates before cross-contract calls  | Low        | Escrow status set before external calls          |
| governance | ❌ Not applicable                             | None       | Soroban execution model prevents reentrant calls |
| others     | ❌ Not needed                                 | None       | Soroban host-level reentrancy protection         |

**Soroban Reentrancy Context:** The Soroban host runtime does not allow reentrant contract calls by default. However, the `token` contract implements an additional mutex for defense-in-depth.

| Raw `+`/`-`              | Only on verified-bounds loops and constants               | ✅ All occurrences reviewed and deemed safe |
| `overflow-checks = true` | Enabled in release profile (Cargo.toml)                   | ✅ Panics on overflow in debug/release      |
