## 2. Data Flows

```
User registration
  ├─ Email + password received over HTTPS
  ├─ Password bcrypt-hashed before storage (never stored plain)
  └─ Email stored in users table (encrypted at rest via pgcrypto / storage-level AES-256)

KYC verification
  ├─ Documents uploaded over HTTPS
  ├─ Forwarded to third-party KYC provider (Synaps / Persona)
  ├─ Only provider reference ID stored server-side
  └─ Raw document files stored in S3 with SSE-S3 (AES-256) and pre-signed URLs

Payment
  ├─ Card details never touch Brain-Storm servers (Stripe.js / Elements)
  ├─ Stripe customer ID and payment intent ID stored in payments / subscriptions tables
  └─ Payment method details held exclusively by Stripe

Email delivery
  ├─ Recipient email passed to email queue
  ├─ Delivered via SMTP / SendGrid; not logged to application log
  └─ Email queue records purged after 30 days (see §4)
```

## 3. Encryption at Rest

### 3.1 Database (PostgreSQL)

| Layer                                             | Mechanism                                                                    | Status                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Storage-level                                     | AES-256 via managed cloud provider disk encryption (AWS RDS / GCP Cloud SQL) | Required – enforce in infrastructure provisioning |
| Column-level (mfaSecret)                          | Recommend `pgcrypto` `pgp_sym_encrypt` for `mfaSecret` and `mfaBackupCodes`  | Planned – add migration                           |
| Column-level (invitedEmail in OrganizationMember) | Recommend `pgcrypto` for `invitedEmail`                                      | Planned – add migration                           |
| Passwords                                         | bcrypt (cost ≥ 12) – one-way, not reversible                                 | Implemented                                       |

**Immediate action (storage-level):** Confirm RDS/Cloud SQL encryption flag is enabled in Terraform/IaC before next deployment. See `infra/` Terraform files.

### 3.2 File Storage (S3 / GCS)

| Bucket                      | Contents               | Encryption                                            |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `brain-storm-kyc-documents` | KYC identity documents | SSE-S3 (AES-256) – must be enforced via bucket policy |
| `brain-storm-cdn-assets`    | Course media, avatars  | SSE-S3 (AES-256)                                      |

Enforce with bucket policy denying `s3:PutObject` if `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header is absent.

### 3.3 Redis (Cache / Queue)

- Redis at-rest encryption: enable via `at-rest-encryption-enabled = true` in ElastiCache (or equivalent).
- Redis stores session tokens and BullMQ job payloads; job payloads should not contain raw PII — pass only IDs.

## 4. Log Sanitization

### Rules

1. **Never log**: email addresses, passwords, tokens, MFA secrets, KYC metadata, Stripe keys.
2. **Redact from error payloads**: replace PII with `[REDACTED]` before passing to Sentry or Winston.
3. **Allowed in logs**: user UUIDs, course IDs, timestamp, HTTP method, path, status code.

### Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Winston `format` pipeline includes a `redact` transform that strips fields: `email`, `password`, `token`, `mfaSecret`, `mfaBackupCodes`, `stripeCustomerId`, `invitedEmail`.
- [ ] Sentry `beforeSend` hook strips `request.data.password`, `request.data.email`, and any header containing `Authorization`.
- [ ] `AuditLog.changedData` snapshots must mask PII columns before storage (store hashes of email, not raw value).
- [ ] Error responses from NestJS exception filters must not echo back request body fields.

## 5. Data Retention & Minimisation Policy

| Data Category                  | Retention Period                                     | Deletion Method                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User account (active)          | Indefinite while active                              | Soft-delete (`deletedAt`); hard-delete after 90 days of soft-delete |
| User account (deleted by user) | 30 days                                              | Hard delete after 30-day grace period                               |
| Email queue records            | 30 days                                              | Scheduled purge job (BullMQ)                                        |
| Access logs                    | 90 days                                              | Rolling delete in `access_logs` table                               |
| Audit logs                     | 1 year (compliance)                                  | Archive to S3 after 1 year, delete from DB                          |
| KYC documents                  | Duration of legal obligation (typically 5 years AML) | Delete from S3 after 5 years; notify provider                       |
| Analytics events               | 2 years                                              | Rolling delete partitioned by `createdAt`                           |
| Search analytics               | 6 months                                             | Rolling delete                                                      |
| Payment records                | 7 years (financial regulation)                       | Retain in cold storage; restrict access                             |
| Refresh tokens                 | 30 days or until revoked                             | Delete expired entries weekly                                       |
| Verification tokens            | 24 hours                                             | Delete on use or expiry                                             |

### Minimisation Principles

- Collect only fields required for the stated purpose.
- `mfaBackupCodes` stored as hashed values (not plaintext) — migrate existing plaintext codes.
- `OrganizationMember.invitedEmail` deleted once invite is accepted or expired (7-day expiry).
- `KycDocument.metadata` field: store only the provider reference and status; do not cache raw provider identity JSON.

## 8. Review Cadence

- **Quarterly**: Review PII inventory for new columns/tables added since last review.
- **On every schema change**: Update this document's PII inventory table.
- **Annually**: Full GDPR/CCPA compliance audit; update retention schedule if regulation changes.
