## Data Collection and Storage Practices

### Legal Basis for Processing

| Purpose                                 | Legal basis (GDPR Art. 6)                      |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Account creation and authentication     | Contract performance (Art. 6(1)(b))            |
| Course progress and credential issuance | Contract performance (Art. 6(1)(b))            |
| KYC identity verification               | Legal obligation (Art. 6(1)(c))                |
| Email notifications                     | Legitimate interest / consent (Art. 6(1)(a/f)) |
| Analytics and platform improvement      | Legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f))             |

### Personal Data Collected

#### `users` table (PostgreSQL)

| Field               | Description                          | Personal data          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `id`                | UUID primary key                     | No                     |
| `email`             | Login identifier and contact address | **Yes**                |
| `username`          | Display name (optional)              | **Yes**                |
| `passwordHash`      | bcrypt hash — plaintext never stored | No                     |
| `avatar`            | Profile image URL                    | **Yes**                |
| `bio`               | Free-text self-description           | **Yes**                |
| `stellarPublicKey`  | Stellar wallet address               | **Yes** (pseudonymous) |
| `role`              | `student` / `instructor` / `admin`   | No                     |
| `isBanned`          | Account status flag                  | No                     |
| `isVerified`        | Email verification status            | No                     |
| `deletedAt`         | Soft-delete timestamp                | No                     |
| `verificationToken` | One-time email verification hash     | No                     |
| `mfaEnabled`        | MFA status flag                      | No                     |
| `mfaSecret`         | TOTP secret (encrypted at rest)      | **Yes**                |
| `createdAt`         | Account creation timestamp           | No                     |

#### `kyc_customers` table (PostgreSQL)

| Field              | Description                                  | Personal data          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `stellarPublicKey` | Links KYC record to user                     | **Yes** (pseudonymous) |
| `status`           | `none` / `pending` / `approved` / `rejected` | No                     |
| `providerId`       | Session ID from Synaps.io KYC provider       | **Yes**                |

KYC identity documents (passport, ID card, selfie) are processed and stored exclusively by the third-party provider **Synaps.io**. Brain-Storm does not receive or store raw identity documents.

#### `notifications` table (PostgreSQL)

Stores `userId`, notification `type` (`enrollment`, `completion`, `credential_issued`), and a `message` string. No additional personal data beyond the user reference.

#### `refresh_tokens` and `password_reset_tokens` tables

Short-lived tokens linked to `userId`. Contain no personal data beyond the user reference and expiry timestamp.

#### `api_keys` table

Hashed API keys linked to `userId`. The plaintext key is shown once at creation and never stored.

#### Redis (in-memory)

Used for:

- Rate-limit counters (keyed by IP or user ID — no personal data stored)
- Short-lived cache entries (e.g. leaderboard, token balances — keyed by Stellar public key)
- Session data (if applicable)

Redis data is ephemeral and not persisted to disk in the default configuration.

#### Stellar Blockchain (on-chain)

Course completion credentials are recorded on the Stellar ledger as `ManageData` entries and via Soroban contract state. **On-chain data is permanent and cannot be deleted.** Only the Stellar public key (pseudonymous) and a course identifier are written on-chain — no names, emails, or other directly identifying information.

### Data Minimisation

- Passwords are never stored in plaintext — only bcrypt hashes.
- MFA secrets are stored encrypted at rest.
- `username`, `avatar`, `bio`, and `stellarPublicKey` are all optional.
- KYC documents are never stored by Brain-Storm — only the provider session ID and approval status.

### Third-Party Processors

| Processor                   | Purpose                   | Data shared                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Synaps.io                   | KYC identity verification | Stellar public key, identity documents             |
| Google OAuth                | Social login              | Email, name (from Google profile)                  |
| Sentry                      | Error monitoring          | Stack traces, request metadata (no PII by default) |
| AWS (ECS, RDS, ElastiCache) | Infrastructure hosting    | All data at rest                                   |

Ensure Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) are in place with each processor before going to production.

## User Data Export

GDPR Article 20 grants users the **right to data portability** — the right to receive their personal data in a structured, machine-readable format.

### Current State

A dedicated data export endpoint does not yet exist. The following implementation is required to achieve GDPR compliance.

### Required Implementation

Add a `GET /v1/users/:id/export` endpoint that returns all personal data held for the authenticated user:

```typescript
// users.controller.ts
@Get(':id/export')
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)
@ApiOperation({ summary: 'Export all personal data for the authenticated user (GDPR Art. 20)' })
async exportData(
  @Param('id') id: string,
  @Request() req: { user: { id: string } },
) {
  if (req.user.id !== id) throw new ForbiddenException();
  return this.usersService.exportUserData(id);
}
```

```typescript
// users.service.ts
async exportUserData(id: string) {
  const user = await this.repo.findOne({ where: { id } });
  if (!user) throw new NotFoundException();

  // Omit sensitive internal fields
  const { passwordHash, verificationToken, mfaSecret, ...profile } = user;

  return {
    exportedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    profile,
    // Extend to include enrollments, progress, notifications, credentials
  };
}
```

The response must be JSON (or optionally CSV) and must cover all tables that reference the user's ID.

### Data Export Scope

A complete export must include:

| Data category                                                             | Source                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Profile (email, username, avatar, bio, stellarPublicKey, role, createdAt) | `users` table                       |
| KYC status and provider reference                                         | `kyc_customers` table               |
| Course enrollments                                                        | `enrollments` table                 |
| Course progress                                                           | `progress` table                    |
| Notifications                                                             | `notifications` table               |
| Credentials issued                                                        | Stellar ledger (transaction hashes) |

## Data Deletion Procedures

### Right to Erasure (GDPR Art. 17)

Users have the right to request deletion of their personal data. Brain-Storm implements **soft deletion** — setting `deletedAt` on the `users` row — which excludes the user from all queries while preserving referential integrity.

#### Soft Delete (current implementation)

```typescript
// UsersService.softDelete()
async softDelete(id: string) {
  const user = await this.findById(id);
  return this.repo.save({ ...user, deletedAt: new Date() });
}
```

Soft-deleted users:

- Are excluded from all `findAll` queries (`WHERE deletedAt IS NULL`)
- Cannot log in (authentication checks `deletedAt`)
- Retain their row for referential integrity with enrollments, credentials, and notifications

#### Hard Delete (required for full GDPR compliance)

To fully honour erasure requests, a hard delete procedure must anonymise or remove the personal data fields while preserving non-personal records:

```typescript
async hardDelete(id: string) {
  await this.repo.update(id, {
    email: `deleted-${id}@deleted.invalid`,
    username: null,
    avatar: null,
    bio: null,
    stellarPublicKey: null,
    passwordHash: '',
    mfaSecret: null,
    verificationToken: null,
    deletedAt: new Date(),
  });
}
```

> **Note:** On-chain Stellar records (credentials, `ManageData` entries) are **immutable** and cannot be deleted. This is a known limitation of blockchain-based credential systems and should be disclosed in the platform's privacy notice. Only the Stellar public key (pseudonymous) is stored on-chain.

#### Admin-Triggered Deletion

Admins can soft-delete any user via:

```http
DELETE /v1/admin/users/:id
Authorization: Bearer <admin-jwt>
```

Self-service deletion (user deleting their own account) requires a dedicated endpoint — currently not implemented.

### KYC Data Deletion

KYC records in the `kyc_customers` table can be deleted directly. For data held by Synaps.io, submit a deletion request through their data subject request process per your DPA.

### Redis Cache Invalidation

When a user is deleted, invalidate any cached entries keyed to their ID or Stellar public key:

```typescript
await this.cacheManager.del(`token_balance:${user.stellarPublicKey}`);
await this.cacheManager.del('leaderboard:top50');
```

## Cookie Policy and Consent Management

### Cookies Currently in Use

Brain-Storm does not set first-party cookies for tracking or advertising. The following technical cookies may be set:

| Cookie                               | Purpose                    | Type               | Duration             |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| `access_token` (if stored in cookie) | JWT authentication         | Strictly necessary | Session / JWT expiry |
| `next-intl` locale preference        | Language selection         | Functional         | 1 year               |
| `theme`                              | Dark/light mode preference | Functional         | 1 year               |

> If JWTs are stored in `localStorage` rather than `HttpOnly` cookies, no authentication cookie is set. Confirm the storage mechanism before publishing the cookie policy.

### Third-Party Cookies

- **Sentry** may set cookies for session replay if enabled. Review Sentry's cookie documentation and disable session replay if not required.
- **Google OAuth** sets cookies during the OAuth flow on `accounts.google.com` — these are subject to Google's own cookie policy.

### Consent Management Requirements

Under GDPR, strictly necessary cookies do not require consent. Functional and analytics cookies do.

#### Required Implementation

A cookie consent banner must be added to the frontend before launch. Recommended approach:

1. On first visit, display a consent banner before setting any non-essential cookies.
2. Store the user's consent choice in `localStorage` (e.g. `cookie_consent: "accepted" | "rejected"`).
3. Only initialise analytics/monitoring scripts after consent is granted.

```typescript
// apps/frontend/src/lib/consent.ts
export function hasConsent(): boolean {
  return localStorage.getItem('cookie_consent') === 'accepted';
}

export function setConsent(accepted: boolean) {
  localStorage.setItem('cookie_consent', accepted ? 'accepted' : 'rejected');
}
```

```tsx
// Conditionally load Sentry only after consent
if (hasConsent()) {
  await import('../instrument'); // Sentry initialisation
}
```

## Data Retention Policies

### Recommended Retention Periods

| Data category             | Retention period                                     | Basis                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Active user accounts      | Duration of account + 30 days after deletion request | Contract               |
| Soft-deleted user records | 30 days, then hard delete / anonymise                | GDPR Art. 5(1)(e)      |
| Password reset tokens     | 1 hour (enforced at application level)               | Minimisation           |
| Email verification tokens | 24 hours (enforced at application level)             | Minimisation           |
| Refresh tokens            | 7 days (or until revoked)                            | Security               |
| API keys                  | Until revoked by user                                | Contract               |
| Notifications             | 90 days                                              | Legitimate interest    |
| KYC records (Brain-Storm) | Duration of account + 5 years                        | Legal obligation (AML) |
| KYC documents (Synaps.io) | Per Synaps.io DPA                                    | Legal obligation       |
| Application logs          | 30 days                                              | Legitimate interest    |
| Redis cache entries       | Per TTL (30 s – 5 min)                               | Technical necessity    |
| On-chain Stellar records  | Permanent (immutable)                                | Blockchain limitation  |

### Automated Retention Enforcement

Implement a scheduled job to enforce retention periods:

```typescript
// Example: purge soft-deleted users older than 30 days
@Cron('0 2 * * *') // daily at 02:00
async purgeDeletedUsers() {
  const cutoff = new Date(Date.now() - 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
  await this.repo
    .createQueryBuilder()
    .delete()
    .from(User)
    .where('deletedAt IS NOT NULL AND deletedAt < :cutoff', { cutoff })
    .execute();
}
```
