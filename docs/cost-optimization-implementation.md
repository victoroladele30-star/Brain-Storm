# Infrastructure Cost Optimization Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive cost optimization implementation for the Brain-Storm infrastructure on AWS, addressing issue #515. The implementation includes cost analysis, reserved instance tracking, auto-scaling policies, resource optimization, and cost monitoring capabilities.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Cost Analysis Module (`infra/terraform/modules/cost-analysis/`)

A comprehensive cost analysis module that integrates with AWS Cost Management services:

**Features**:

- AWS Cost Explorer integration
- Cost Anomaly Detection and Alerts
- Budget alerts with SNS notifications
- Cost allocation tags and categorization
- CloudWatch logging for cost tracking

**Resources Created**:

- `aws_ce_cost_category` - Categorizes costs by service type
- `aws_ce_anomaly_monitor` - Detects unusual cost patterns
- `aws_ce_anomaly_subscription` - Routes anomalies to SNS
- `aws_budgets_budget` - Monthly budget tracking with alerts
- `aws_sns_topic` - Notification channel for cost alerts
- `aws_cloudwatch_log_group` - Logs for cost analysis events

**Configuration Variables**:

```hcl
monthly_budget_limit = 5000      # Alert at $5,000/month
cost_alert_email     = "ops@..."  # Email for cost alerts
```

**Usage**:

```hcl
module "cost_analysis" {
  source = "./modules/cost-analysis"
  environment          = "prod"
  monthly_budget_limit = 5000
  cost_alert_email     = "ops@example.com"
}
```

### 2. Savings Plans Module Enhancement (`infra/terraform/modules/savings-plans/`)

Enhanced the existing savings-plans module with comprehensive reserved instance and savings plan tracking:

**Features**:

- RDS Reserved Instance recommendations
- ElastiCache Reserved Node recommendations
- Compute Savings Plan recommendations
- Inventory tracking of purchased reserved capacity
- Annual savings calculations

**Reserved Instance Recommendations**:

- **RDS**: 1-year no-upfront, 40% savings (~$5,760/year)
- **ElastiCache**: 1-year no-upfront, 38% savings (~$2,880/year)
- **Compute**: 1-year no-upfront Savings Plan, 20% savings (~$5,040/year)
- **Total Annual Potential Savings**: ~$13,680

**Tracked via AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Parameters**:

- `/{environment}/cost-optimization/rds-reserved-instance`
- `/{environment}/cost-optimization/elasticache-reserved-node`
- `/{environment}/cost-optimization/fargate-savings-plan`
- `/{environment}/cost-optimization/reserved-instances-inventory`

### 3. Auto-Scaling Policies Enhancement (`infra/terraform/modules/autoscaling/`)

Enhanced auto-scaling with cost optimization features:

**ECS Service Scaling**:

- CPU and Memory-based scaling for Backend and Frontend services
- Configurable min/max capacity per environment
- Scale-out cooldown: 60 seconds
- Scale-in cooldown: 300 seconds

**Scheduled Scaling (Non-Prod Only)**:

- **Scale Down**: 20:00 UTC weekdays (reduce to min=1, max=2)
- **Scale Up**: 08:00 UTC weekdays (restore to full capacity)
- **Savings**: ~$200/month for dev/staging environments

**Cost Optimization Configuration**:

```hcl
backend_min_capacity  = 2
backend_max_capacity  = 5    # Cost: ~$280/month per extra task
frontend_min_capacity = 2
frontend_max_capacity = 3    # Cost: ~$140/month per extra task
```

**Monitoring**:

- CloudWatch alarms for high CPU/Memory
- SSM Parameter storing autoscaling config and estimated savings

### 4. Cost Monitoring Rules (`infra/monitoring/prometheus/cost-optimization-rules.yml`)

Prometheus recording rules and alerts for infrastructure cost monitoring:

**Recording Rules**:

- Container resource utilization metrics
- Node-level CPU, memory, and disk utilization
- Database and cache metrics
- Hourly and monthly cost estimation

**Alerting Rules**:

- `HighContainerResourceWaste`: Pods using <10% of allocated resources
- `DatabaseHighUtilization`: RDS CPU > 80%
- `CacheHighUtilization`: ElastiCache CPU > 75%
- `UnderutilizedInfrastructure`: Multiple under-utilized pods detected

### 5. Cost Optimization Report Generator (`scripts/cost-optimization-report.sh`)

Automated bash script that generates comprehensive cost optimization reports:

**Report Sections**:

1. Current Cost Analysis
   - Monthly breakdown by service
   - Cost trends and growth analysis
   - Cost by resource type

2. Reserved Instance Recommendations
   - RDS, ElastiCache, Compute savings plans
   - Estimated annual savings
   - Implementation status

3. Auto-Scaling Effectiveness
   - Current scaling configuration
   - Scaling metrics and effectiveness
   - Potential savings from optimization

4. Resource Utilization Analysis
   - Container CPU/Memory requests vs actual usage
   - Right-sizing opportunities
   - Database and cache utilization

5. Cost Monitoring Implementation
   - Current monitoring status
   - Cost allocation tags coverage
   - Recommendations for improvements

6. Cost Optimization Action Plan
   - Immediate actions (this week)
   - Short-term initiatives (1-2 months)
   - Long-term initiatives (3-6 months)

7. Financial Summary
   - Current monthly cost: $5,000
   - Optimized monthly cost: $3,715 (26% reduction)
   - Total potential annual savings: $15,420

**Usage**:

```bash
# Generate report for production environment
./scripts/cost-optimization-report.sh prod ./reports

# Generate report for staging environment
./scripts/cost-optimization-report.sh staging ./reports

# Generate report for development environment
./scripts/cost-optimization-report.sh dev ./reports
```

**Output**:
