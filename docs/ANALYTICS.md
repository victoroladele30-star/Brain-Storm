## Event Taxonomy

Brain-Storm uses a privacy-respecting event taxonomy for tracking user interactions across the platform.

### Event Categories

| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `discovery`  | Course/instructor discovery and search |
| `profile`    | User profile views and updates         |
| `enrollment` | Course enrollment and progress         |
| `tip`        | Tip transactions                       |
| `review`     | Review submissions and votes           |
| `credential` | Credential issuance and verification   |
| `auth`       | Authentication events                  |

## Event Schema

```typescript
interface AnalyticsEvent {
  eventId: string; // UUID
  eventType: EventType; // From CORE_EVENTS
  timestamp: string; // ISO 8601
  userId?: string; // Anonymized user ID
  sessionId: string; // Session UUID
  source: 'web' | 'mobile' | 'api';
  locale?: string; // Browser locale
  payload: Record<string, unknown>; // Event-specific data (no PII)
}
```

## Privacy & Compliance

### PII Prohibition

The following fields are **never** included in analytics events:

- email, name, fullName, firstName, lastName
- phone, address, dateOfBirth
- password, secret, token, privateKey

### Consent Gating

- `analytics` consent is required for all events except marketing
- `marketing` consent is required for tip-related events

Consent is managed via:

- Backend: `EventsService.setConsent(userId, consent)`
- Frontend: `analytics.setConsent({ analytics: boolean, marketing: boolean })`

### Data Retention

- Analytics events are retained for 90 days
- Automatic cleanup runs daily at 3 AM UTC

## Implementation

### Frontend

```typescript
import { analytics, trackEvent, CORE_EVENTS } from '@/lib/analytics';

// Track a specific event
analytics.trackCourseView('course-123', 'Solidity Basics');

// Or use trackEvent directly
trackEvent(CORE_EVENTS.ENROLLMENT_START, { courseId: '123' });
```

### Backend

Events are automatically captured via NestJS event emitter:

```typescript
this.eventEmitter.emit('enrollment_start', { userId, courseId });
```

### Admin Analytics

Admin dashboards available at `/v1/admin/analytics` with:

- Date range filtering
- Growth metrics
- Tip volume
- Dispute rate
- CSV export

## Dashboard Metrics

The admin dashboard provides:

- `totalUsers` - Platform-wide user count
- `totalCourses` - Published courses count
- `totalEnrollments` - All enrollments
- `totalCompletions` - Completed courses
- `completionRate` - Percentage of completions
- `averageRating` - Average course rating
- `activeWorkers` - Users active in last 30 days
- `tipVolume` - Total tips in period
- `disputeRate` - Percentage of disputed transactions
- `growth` - User growth percentage vs previous period
