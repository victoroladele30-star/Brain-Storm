## Deployment Procedures

### Staging Deployment

**Purpose:** Test deployment process and verify functionality before production.

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes

```bash
# 1. Verify staging environment
./scripts/health-check.sh staging

# 2. Deploy smart contracts (if changed)
./scripts/deploy.sh staging analytics
./scripts/deploy.sh staging token

# 3. Deploy backend
docker build -t brain-storm-backend:staging apps/backend/
docker push brain-storm-backend:staging
kubectl set image deployment/backend backend=brain-storm-backend:staging -n staging

# 4. Run database migrations
kubectl exec -it deployment/backend -n staging -- npm run db:migrate

# 5. Deploy frontend
npm run build:frontend
aws s3 sync apps/frontend/.next s3://brain-storm-staging-frontend/

# 6. Verify deployment
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh staging
```

### Production Deployment

**Purpose:** Deploy to production environment.

**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

**Prerequisites:** Staging deployment successful

```bash
# 1. Create release tag
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release v1.2.0"
git push origin v1.2.0

# 2. Verify production environment
./scripts/health-check.sh production

# 3. Backup production database
./scripts/backup/database-backup.sh production

# 4. Deploy smart contracts (if changed)
./scripts/deploy.sh mainnet analytics
./scripts/deploy.sh mainnet token

# 5. Deploy backend (blue-green)
# Blue-green deployment ensures zero downtime
docker build -t brain-storm-backend:v1.2.0 apps/backend/
docker push brain-storm-backend:v1.2.0

# Deploy to green environment
kubectl set image deployment/backend-green backend=brain-storm-backend:v1.2.0 -n production

# Wait for green to be healthy
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=backend-green -n production --timeout=300s

# Switch traffic to green
kubectl patch service backend -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"green"}}}' -n production

# 6. Run database migrations
kubectl exec -it deployment/backend-green -n production -- npm run db:migrate

# 7. Deploy frontend
npm run build:frontend
aws s3 sync apps/frontend/.next s3://brain-storm-production-frontend/
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id E123ABC --paths "/*"

# 8. Verify deployment
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh production

# 9. Monitor for 30 minutes
./scripts/health-check.sh production --continuous
```

### Hotfix Deployment

**Purpose:** Deploy critical fixes without waiting for release cycle.

**Duration:** 15-30 minutes

```bash
# 1. Create hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue main

# 2. Make fix and test thoroughly
npm run test
npm run lint

# 3. Commit and push
git commit -m "fix: critical issue"
git push -u origin hotfix/critical-issue

# 4. Create PR and get emergency approval
# (Requires only 1 approval for hotfixes)

# 5. Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff hotfix/critical-issue

# 6. Deploy immediately
./scripts/deploy-all.sh production
```

---

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback

Triggered if health checks fail post-deployment:

```bash
# Kubernetes automatically rolls back if readiness probe fails
# Configured in deployment manifest with:
# - readinessProbe: checks /health endpoint
# - livenessProbe: checks /health endpoint
# - maxSurge: 1, maxUnavailable: 0 (rolling update)
```

### Manual Rollback

If automatic rollback doesn't work:

```bash
# 1. Identify previous working version
kubectl rollout history deployment/backend -n production

# 2. Rollback to previous version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/backend -n production

# 3. Verify rollback
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh production

# 4. Restore database if needed
./scripts/backup/restore-database.sh production backup-2024-05-29.sql.gz

# 5. Notify team
# Send incident report to #incidents channel
```

### Database Rollback

If migrations caused issues:

```bash
# 1. Stop application
kubectl scale deployment/backend --replicas=0 -n production

# 2. Restore database backup
./scripts/backup/restore-database.sh production backup-2024-05-29.sql.gz

# 3. Verify restore
psql -h $DATABASE_HOST -U $DATABASE_USER -d brain_storm -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"

# 4. Restart application
kubectl scale deployment/backend --replicas=3 -n production

# 5. Verify health
./scripts/health-check.sh production
```

---

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Immediate Checks (0-5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. API health
curl https://api.brainstorm.dev/health

# 2. Database connectivity
curl https://api.brainstorm.dev/v1/health/db

# 3. Stellar network connectivity
curl https://api.brainstorm.dev/v1/health/stellar

# 4. Frontend loads
curl https://brainstorm.dev/ | grep -q "Brain-Storm"
```

### Functional Checks (5-15 minutes)

```bash
# 1. User authentication
curl -X POST https://api.brainstorm.dev/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password"}'

# 2. Course listing
curl https://api.brainstorm.dev/v1/courses

# 3. Stellar integration
curl https://api.brainstorm.dev/v1/stellar/balance/GXXXXXX

# 4. Frontend functionality
# - Login works
# - Courses load
# - Enrollment works
# - Progress tracking works
```

### Monitoring Checks (15-30 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Error rates
# Check Sentry dashboard for new errors

# 2. Performance metrics
# Check DataDog/New Relic for latency increase

# 3. Database performance
# Check slow query logs

# 4. API rate limiting
# Verify rate limits not being hit

# 5. User reports
# Monitor support channels for issues
```

### Automated Verification

```bash
# Run comprehensive health check
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh production

# Expected output:
# ✓ API responding
# ✓ Database connected
# ✓ Stellar network accessible
# ✓ All services healthy
# ✓ No critical errors
```

## Deployment Troubleshooting

### Issue: Deployment Timeout

**Symptom:** Deployment hangs or times out

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n production

# Check logs
kubectl logs deployment/backend -n production --tail=100

# Increase timeout
kubectl rollout status deployment/backend -n production --timeout=600s

# If still failing, rollback
kubectl rollout undo deployment/backend -n production
```

### Issue: Database Migration Fails

**Symptom:** Migration error during deployment

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check migration status
npm run db:migration:status

# Revert last migration
npm run db:migration:revert

# Fix migration file
# Edit apps/backend/src/migrations/XXX.ts

# Re-run migration
npm run db:migrate

# Verify data integrity
psql -h $DATABASE_HOST -U $DATABASE_USER -d brain_storm -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"
```

### Issue: Smart Contract Deployment Fails

**Symptom:** Contract deployment error

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check contract build
cd contracts/analytics
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Verify Stellar account has funds
stellar account info $STELLAR_PUBLIC_KEY --network testnet

# Check contract ID
cat scripts/deployed-contracts.json

# Retry deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh mainnet analytics --force
```

### Issue: High Error Rate Post-Deployment

**Symptom:** Errors spike after deployment

**Solution:**

```bash
# 1. Check error logs
kubectl logs deployment/backend -n production --tail=200 | grep ERROR

# 2. Check recent changes
git log --oneline -10

# 3. Rollback if critical
kubectl rollout undo deployment/backend -n production

# 4. Investigate root cause
# - Check database state
# - Check Stellar network status
# - Check environment variables
# - Review recent code changes
```
