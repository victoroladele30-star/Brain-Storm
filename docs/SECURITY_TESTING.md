# Security Testing Checklist

## Overview

Repeatable penetration testing checklist mapped to OWASP Top 10 (2021) categories. Run this against staging before every major release and after significant auth, API, or file-handling changes.

---

## How to Use

1. Assign a tester and a target environment (staging URL).
2. Work through each section. Mark each item **PASS**, **FAIL**, or **N/A**.
3. For each **FAIL**, file an issue with severity (`CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW`) and an owner.
4. After fixes are deployed, re-run only the failed items and update the **Re-test** column.

## Finding Log

Track findings here and link to GitHub Issues.

| Date | Tester | Item # | Finding Summary | Severity | GitHub Issue | Owner | Fixed Date | Re-test Result |
| ---- | ------ | ------ | --------------- | -------- | ------------ | ----- | ---------- | -------------- |
|      |        |        |                 |          |              |       |            |                |

## Re-test Protocol

After the owner marks an issue as fixed:

1. Deploy fix to staging.
2. Tester re-runs only the relevant checklist item.
3. Update **Re-test** column with `PASS` / `FAIL` and date.
4. Close the GitHub issue only after `PASS` is recorded.
